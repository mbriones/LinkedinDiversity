Compared with the conventional methods, the computational gain of these algorithms is up to the order of thousands with minor degradation in accuracy for moderately large problems.

In order to meet the varied needs of our wide customer-base, we combine rich content-based features and modern collaborative-filtering models with our highly-configurable content-filtering/segmentation service.During my time at Boomtrain, I was primarily responsible for the research, design and implementation of our personalized models. Working at a small-stage startup also gave me opportunities to work in a number of different capacities - most notably, I played a primary role in the vision and architecture behind our real-time scoring engine and the associated training pipeline.The tools I used at Boomtrain include:. Python, Java, and NodeJS (for our various services - all communicating over Thrift). Tensorflow (for the implementation our models and scorers). Luigi (for our data-pipeline dependency management and scheduling). Kafka and Redshift (for the storage and analysis of behavioral data). Elasticsearch and Aerospike (for content segmentation and attribute-retrieval).

Our prototype was over an order of magnitude faster than the existing process at a similar price-point (we achieved this using a combination of Cuckoo and RobinHood hashing, maximizing the number of independent models we could store in GPU-memory).The tools I used at Quantast include:.

My team is directly responsible for significant amount of incremental revenue.Responsibilities & Achievements- Built the ticket recommendations project from scratch, which ranks tickets in an event by best deal and best seat:https://www.stubhub.com/best-value- Developed the machine learning model for ticket recommendation which combines history transactional data and prior information extracted from map metadata via a state of the art regularization method- This project has resulted in significantly lift in GMV ( >$100 MM annually) and much better user experience by reducing the search cost of users- In multiple eBay earnings call in 2016, this project was mentioned as the main growth engine for Stubhub: \"We delivered GMV growth of 29% and we grew revenue by 34%. We had a strong quarter in Sports and Concerts in addition to launching a number of product innovations like ticket recommendations, which helped fans find the best value for the tickets they want.\"-  Lead the effort on Dynamic Pricing project, which aims at providing a comprehensive real-time pricing solution to sellers. Design the roadmap and coordinate the work among various contributors. Built the industrial leading dynamic pricing algorithm and created interactive visualizations to provide advanced market insights to brokers and content right holders.- Worked on product analytics to

       "46   My PhD research involves development of fast and memory efficient machine learning algorithms for sophisticated analysis of large-scale databases. The techniques I utilise include variational Bayesian approximations, Monte chain Monte Carlo methods, semi-parametric penalization, graphical models and scalable/real time prediction. The proposed algorithms are available in R and Fortran, and have been applied in a wide variety of medical and social science studies, which typically have data with complex grouped structure and nonlinear outcome-predictor relationships.I am highly experienced in programming in statistical software including R, SAS, Stata, Stan and (beginner: Python and MySQL). I have experience in writing peer-reviewed scientific papers and government reports, as well as presenting to both technical and lay audiences. I am always curious, eager to learn and have an entrepreneurial personality. I enjoy working with people from different analytical backgrounds and in a challenging and dynamic environment.\\n\\n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "326  My experiences in theoretical researches, up-to-date projects and commercial model construction have both reinforced my understanding of the mathematics and finance related knowledge learnt in class. They also polished my practical skills like mining and visualizing data of large size, applying machine learning algorithms and handling model failures, which have recently become my personal favorite areas. In addition, through the various extracurricular activities I developed sound interpersonal, oral and written communication skills, and gained sufficient presentation skills through reporting to senior managers regularly and several speech contest.\\n\\n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "327  I am a data scientist with a physics background. I worked on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN for over five years and performed complex statistical analyses over 100 TB-scale distributed datasets. Recently I transitioned into a data science career and brought key innovation into the field of risk analyses through machine learning and other simpler but more robust solutions. I'm skeptical about statistical models and care about experimental uncertainties and biases. My career goal is to apply my analytical skills in a meaningful way to improve people's lives.\\n\\n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
