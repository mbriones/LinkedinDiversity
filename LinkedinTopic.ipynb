Compared with the conventional methods, the computational gain of these algorithms is up to the order of thousands with minor degradation in accuracy for moderately large problems.

which physical perturbations affect cell growthMajor scientific results:• Quantified the phototoxicity effect by measuring the growth rate of E. coli under varying levels of epifluorescence illumination (see below figure)• Confirmed theories of plastic deformation of cell walls by analyzing videos of filamenting E. coli and B. subtilis in microfluidic devicesContributed to establishing

In order to meet the varied needs of our wide customer-base, we combine rich content-based features and modern collaborative-filtering models with our highly-configurable content-filtering/segmentation service.During my time at Boomtrain, I was primarily responsible for the research, design and implementation of our personalized models. Working at a small-stage startup also gave me opportunities to work in a number of different capacities - most notably, I played a primary role in the vision and architecture behind our real-time scoring engine and the associated training pipeline.The tools I used at Boomtrain include:. Python, Java, and NodeJS (for our various services - all communicating over Thrift). Tensorflow (for the implementation our models and scorers). Luigi (for our data-pipeline dependency management and scheduling). Kafka and Redshift (for the storage and analysis of behavioral data).

Our prototype was over an order of magnitude faster than the existing process at a similar price-point (we achieved this using a combination of Cuckoo and RobinHood hashing, maximizing the number of independent models we could store in GPU-memory).The tools I used at Quantast include:.

My team is directly responsible for significant amount of incremental revenue.Responsibilities & Achievements- Built the ticket recommendations project from scratch, which ranks tickets in an event by best deal and best seat:https://www.stubhub.com/best-value- Developed the machine learning model for ticket recommendation which combines history transactional data and prior information extracted from map metadata via a state of the art regularization method- This project has resulted in significantly lift in GMV ( >$100 MM annually) and much better user experience by reducing the search cost of users- In multiple eBay earnings call in 2016, this project was mentioned as the main growth engine for Stubhub: \"We delivered GMV growth of 29% and we grew revenue by 34%. We had a strong quarter in Sports and Concerts in addition to launching a number of product innovations like ticket recommendations, which helped fans find the best value for the tickets they want.\"-  Lead the effort on Dynamic Pricing project, which aims at providing a comprehensive real-time pricing solution to sellers. Design the roadmap and coordinate the work among various contributors. Built the industrial leading dynamic pricing algorithm and created interactive visualizations to provide advanced market insights to brokers and content right holders.- Worked on product analytics to
