The work helped organizations to better understand their customers and risks, spot anomalies, and tackle real-world problems.As a Data Science Intern at LinkedIn, my work largely involved doing exploratory data analysis that helped understand how the consumers are using the LinkedIn News Feed. My background in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at CMU has helped me hone my descriptive and predictive analytics skills. With courses like Experimental Design, Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Mining and Advanced Business Analytics, I have built an expertise in analyzing and visualizing large datasets. My strong technical acumen was complemented by a course on Managing Analytics Projects, which helped me gain deeper insights into the specific issues any analytics project faces, and their solutions. The core strength of a Data Scientist is programming – something that my work experience at ThoughtWorks Technologies as a Senior Application Developer helped me excel at. A typical day for me involved interacting with clients and business analysts, analyzing and breaking down problems into user stories, estimation of stories, brainstorming and programming. Working on multiple projects allowed me to dabble with multiple technologies which in turn helped me build a critical skill – picking up new technologies quickly.

       "2    I have been learning and working in analytics since 2012. There are many reasons why I love this field.

       "3    Data Science, as evident, involves scientific thinking around data and communicating it to non-technical audience, is an art, and I work at the intersection of this art and science. I started my journey, back in 2013, with Andrew Ng’s lectures, working on fancy hand-writing recognition algorithms using Neural Nets, which led me to my internship at Zomato , where I experimented with Natural Language Processing for the first time and since then I have come a long way, worked on an online NLP based debating framework to help school students, presented at various platforms on topics pertaining to NLP. I love to read about ML, particularly, deep learning and one of my goals this year is to finish 14 Analytics MOOC’s . I have delivered a talk on NLP at PyCon Bangalore and a poster a PyCon USA. Apart from my work, I play Basketball, taking advantage of the fact that I am a tall guy. I listen to music all the time, as it helps me to think amid a loud environment.

       "18   The pursuit to uncover the stories hidden in the data led me to the field of Data Science. Currently I am working at Facebook to solve Data Science problems at scale! As a part of the Advanced Analytics & Modeling practice at Deloitte, I worked on projects for clients across different sectors like Insurance, Banking, Retail, Higher Education, etc. These projects typically used data and advanced analytics technologies to help clients make informed business decisions. The work helped organizations to better understand their customers and risks, spot anomalies, and tackle real-world problems.As a Data Science Intern at LinkedIn, my work largely involved doing exploratory data analysis that helped understand how the consumers are using the LinkedIn News Feed. My background in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at CMU has helped me hone my descriptive and predictive analytics skills. With courses like Experimental Design, Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Mining and Advanced Business Analytics, I have built an expertise in analyzing and visualizing large datasets. My strong technical acumen was complemented by a course on Managing Analytics Projects, which helped me gain deeper insights into the specific issues any analytics project faces, and their solutions. The core strength of a Data Scientist is programming – something that my work experience at ThoughtWorks Technologies as a Senior Application Developer helped me excel at. A typical day for me involved interacting with clients and business analysts, analyzing and breaking down problems into user stories, estimation of stories, brainstorming and programming. Working on multiple projects allowed me to dabble with multiple technologies which in turn helped me build a critical skill – picking up new technologies quickly.

       "25   I am a data scientist at Amazon.com working on the seller misconduct team to identify and restrict bad actors from committing fraud on the Amazon platform. I completed my graduate degree in the Analytics program at Georgia Institute of Technology. My concentration of study at tech was Computational Data Analytics which focused on machine learning, big data applications, and statistical methods.I was first exposed to data analysis during my final year undergraduate project at IIT, Roorkee. During my subsequent three years in the industry, I worked on projects from diverse fields like supply chain optimization, marketing, insurance, and finance respectively, where I again leveraged data to assist decision making. My graduate studies are centered towards further building my capabilities in the field of data science and learning about the latest techniques in artificial intelligence like deep learning. The two most motivating factors for me in this area of study are:1. The versatility of skills. Each and every industry is experiencing data-driven innovation today and this is set to grow further - this includes societal causes like crime, hunger etc.2. The obsolescence of skills. Due to the fast pace at which the research is progressing in the field, one must always be up to date with the best and latest techniques to maximize impact. This brings along the promise and exciting challenge of perpetual learning.    Outside the data world, I enjoy hiking, reading, fine arts and everything basketball.

       "557  Data scientist with a strong quantitative and technical background in physics and programming. Four years' experience in business intelligence and data science, and four years' experience in data analytical-heavy coding and research -- designing my own analytical tools, handling large sets of data (tens of millions of unique data points), and switching languages as needed. Background in physics demanded high aptitude at solving complex, abstract analytical problems, allowing me to draw connections that were not readily apparent between concepts with ease. Proficient in python, SQL, and C, but comfortable in a host of other languages, and adaptable to any language in which I lack experience.\\n\\n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "566  I have 9+ years of advanced data analysis experience in scientific research where I've communicated my results through presentations and writing. I love working with data, and I excel in creative, faster-paced environments. During my PhD studies in computational cognitive neuroscience, I primarily worked with data from human behavior, functional MRI (3D+time images), and EEG recordings (i.e., extremely noisy time-series). I also have experience from personal projects extracting and handling data from various sources (e.g., web text and GIS maps). I've just started getting into Kaggle competitions (fun!) and will be sharing source code on my github when they're done.Over the years, I have acquired an intuitive understanding of a large set of machine learning and statistical modeling techniques through my research and formal training. As someone who readily seeks to learn and improve, I'm not limited by the tools that I use, but rather, I choose the tools that are suited for solving the problem. Lastly, I place great value in knowledge-sharing, and I enjoy opportunities for collaborative, interdisciplinary teamwork.\\n\\n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
